/*═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  CONTENT PACK — the only place a product, a vendor or a person is named.
  Engine, HUD and mechanics are generic.
    stations : who can be on the dial. `f` is the position along the glass, 0 to 1.
    phrases  : what the customer says. `src` is the true source. Exactly one
               reframe per phrase has answers:true — the one that answers the
               source rather than the sentence.
    hidden   : the competitor actually in the account.
    theme    : optional. See layers/theme/registry.ts for the pack contract;
               tuner/index.html has its own tiny registry (no build step to
               import that .ts from), following the same shape.
